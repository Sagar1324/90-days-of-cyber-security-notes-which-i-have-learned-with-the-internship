# Running Docker within a Kali Linux and setting up a Kali Linux container is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:

# 1. Install Docker on Kali Linux
Ensure Docker is installed on your Kali Linux system. Use the following commands:

Step 1: Update the System

* sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Install Docker

* sudo apt install docker.io

Step 3: Start and Enable Docker Service

* sudo systemctl start docker
* sudo systemctl enable docker
* Step 4: Verify Docker Installation
  
Check the installed Docker version and ensure it's working properly:


* docker --version

Ensure Docker is running:

* sudo systemctl status docker

# 2. Pull Kali Linux Docker Image

After Docker is set up, you can pull the official Kali Linux Docker image from Docker Hub.

* Step 1: Pull Kali Linux Docker Image

* sudo docker pull kalilinux/kali-rolling

This command downloads the Kali Linux image onto your local system.

# 3. Run Kali Linux Container

Once the image is downloaded, you can create and run a Kali Linux container.

Step 1: Start a Kali Linux Container

* sudo docker run -it kalilinux/kali-rolling /bin/bash

The -it option allows you to interact with the container in a terminal (interactive mode).

You should now be inside the Kali Linux container.

# 4. Update and Install Tools Inside the Container

Since this is a minimal Kali Linux image, you'll want to update the package list and install any additional tools you may need.

Step 1: Update Package List

* apt update && apt upgrade

Step 2: Install Kali Tools (Optional)

* apt install kali-linux-top10

You can replace kali-linux-top10 with any other package or tool you want to install.

# 5. Detach and Reattach to the Container

To exit the container while keeping it running, press Ctrl+P followed by Ctrl+Q. To reattach to the running container, use the following command:


* sudo docker attach <container-id>

You can find the container ID by listing all running containers:

* sudo docker ps

# 6. Stopping and Removing Containers

To stop a running container, use:

* sudo docker stop <container-id>

To remove a container (if no longer needed):

* sudo docker rm <container-id>

# 7. Run Kali Linux with Persistent Data

If you want the changes in the container to persist, you can mount a volume from your host system to the container:
