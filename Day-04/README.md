# Day-4:
# Wireshark:
Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and communication protocol development. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network in real-time. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

# What Wireshark Does:
* # Packet Capture:
Wireshark captures network packets (the small chunks of data transmitted over a network) and displays them in detail. This includes information such as the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol being used (e.g., TCP, UDP), and the payload (the actual data being transmitted).

* # Protocol Analysis: 
Wireshark supports deep inspection of hundreds of protocols. It can decode many different types of network protocols, providing detailed insight into what each packet is doing. This is invaluable for diagnosing network issues or understanding how different protocols interact.

* # Real-Time Network Monitoring: 
Wireshark allows users to observe network traffic as it happens. This is useful for spotting anomalies, such as unexpected spikes in traffic or unusual protocol use.

* # Filtering: 
Wireshark provides powerful filtering options that let users focus on specific traffic of interest. For example, you can filter by IP address, protocol type, port number, or even specific fields within a packet.

* # Logging and Exporting:
Captured data can be saved for later analysis. Wireshark can export data in various formats, making it easy to share findings or integrate with other tools.

* # Visualization:
Wireshark includes basic visualization tools like flow graphs and I/O graphs that help users understand network patterns and trend
