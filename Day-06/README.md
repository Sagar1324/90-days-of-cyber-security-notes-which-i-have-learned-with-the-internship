# Task 1
# Subject : Oh no! We’ve been hacked!

It seems like our machine got hacked by an anonymous threat actor. However, we are lucky to have a .pcap file from the attack. Can you determine what happened? Download the .pcap file and use Wireshark to view it.

Before we begin, I think it’s important that we understand what wireshark is.

Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

First of all, if we apply some configurations on Wireshark, the analysis process will be easier for us.
