# DAY-3:
# Basic Linux commands:
1 •  ls : List directory contents
* The ls command in Linux lists files and directories in a specified directory. It's a basic command that's part of the GNU core utilities package, which is installed on all Linux distributions. By default, ls lists files in alphabetical order by name in the current directory. You can also use ls to interact with files and directories via the command line, similar to how you use a GUI in Finder or File Explorer. 

2 •  cd : Change directory
* The cd command in Linux, short for "change directory", is used to switch the current working directory to a new one. It's a command-line shell command that can be used in most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, and is one of the most common commands used by Linux users

3 •  pwd : Print working directory
* The pwd command is one of the most frequently used commands for everyday tasks, especially if you often switch between directories or work with many subdirectories. It's available as a built-in command and as a stand-alone program, and is included in the standard installation of most common Linux distributions, such as Debian or Ubuntu. 

4 •  mkdir : Make a directory
* The mkdir command in Linux is a command-line utility that allows users to create one or more directories. It's short for "make directory" and is a fundamental tool for organizing file systems and streamlining workflows in Linux. 

5 •  rmdir : Remove directory
* The rmdir command in Linux removes empty directories from the system. It's a useful tool for managing directory structures and cleaning up the file system by removing unnecessary or unused directories. The rmdir command is often used in shell scripts and other automated tasks to ensure efficient use of system resources
6 •  touch : Create a new file
* It is used to create a file without any content. The file created using the touch command is empty. This command can be used when the user doesn't have data to store at the time of file creation.

7 •  rm : Remove files or directories
* rm stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on from the file system like UNIX. To be more precise, rm removes references to objects from the filesystem, where those objects might have had multiple references (for example, a file with two different names). By default, it does not remove directories. This command normally works silently and you should be very careful while running rm command because once you delete the files then you are not able to recover the contents of files and directories.

8 •  cp : Copy files or directories
* In the world of Linux computers, a common and important job is copying files. The key tool for this task is the “cp” command. In this simple guide, we’ll explore how to copy a file in Linux, looking at the basic steps, different choices you can make, and giving clear examples. We’ll also take a peek behind the scenes to understand how the “cp” command works. Let’s get started on this easy journey to become familiar with the ins and outs of copying files in Linux!

9 •  mv : Move or rename files or directories
* The `mv` command in Linux is like a superhero tool that can do a bunch of cool stuff with your files and folders. Think of it as a digital moving truck that helps you shift things around in your computer. Whether you want to tidy up your folders, give your files new names, or send them to different places, `mv` is the go-to friend for the job. It’s a basic tool that every person using Linux should know about. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how you can use the mv command for different tasks, and I’ll show you step-by-step examples to make it super easy to understand. So, buckle up, and let’s explore the many tricks the mv command has up its sleeve!

10 •  man : Display the user manual
* man command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal. It provides a detailed view of the command which includes NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUES, ERRORS, FILES, VERSIONS, EXAMPLES, AUTHORS and SEE ALSO

11 •  echo : Display a message or data
* The echo command in Linux is a built-in tool that displays text or strings passed as arguments on the command line. It's a basic command that's often used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to a file or the screen. 

12 •  chmod : Change file permissions
* The chmod command, short for "change mode", is used to manage file system access permissions on Linux and Unix-like systems. It allows administrators to set or modify file permissions for a file or directory.
13 •  chown : Change file owner and group
* The chown command can be combined with other commands to manage file permissions and access control. For example, Linux has three different kinds of file permissions: read, write, and execute. Within each level, there are three bits corresponding to each permission. 

14 •  ps : Display a list of currently running processes
* The ps command is used to view currently running processes on the system. It helps us to determine which process is doing what in our system, how much memory it is using, how much CPU space it occupies, user ID, command name, etc .

15 •  kill : Kill a process
* kill command in Linux (located in /bin/kill), is a built-in command which is used to terminate processes manually. kill command sends a signal to a process that terminates the process. If the user doesn’t specify any signal that is to be sent along with the kill command, then a default TERM signal is sent that terminates the process.
  
16 •  top : Display system summary and processes
* The top Command. The top command is used to show the active Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. Usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux kernel.
  
17 •  df : Display disk space usage
* The df command in Linux, short for "disk free", displays information about the total, used, and available space on mounted file systems
  
18 •  du : Estimate file and directory space usage
* The du command in Linux, which is short for "disk usage", is a standard Unix program that estimates how much file space is used by a directory or files on a file system. It's a useful tool for managing disk space and can help you identify files or directories that are using too much storage.
  
19 •  cat : Concatenate and display file content
* The cat command in Linux, which stands for "concatenate", is a versatile tool that can be used to display, combine, and create files. It can read one or more files and print their contents to the terminal.
  
20 •  nano : Text editors
* Nano is a simple, command-line text editor for Unix-based operating systems, including Linux. It's often prepackaged on Linux PCs and servers, and is part of the standard Ubuntu installation. Nano's intuitive interface and keyboard shortcuts make it easy to edit text files, scripts, and configuration files. It's suitable for both beginners and advanced users, and is less powerful than other programs like vi and Emacs. 

21 •  clear : Clear the terminal screen
* The clear command in Linux clears the contents of the terminal screen, making the command prompt the first line at the top of the screen. This can be useful when the screen looks messy after working for a long time, or when users want to focus on their task without being distracted by previous command outputs and system messages.
  
22 •  exit : Exit the terminal
* The exit command in Linux is a shell built-in that terminates the shell or program. It can be used in many operating system command-line shells and scripting languages.
